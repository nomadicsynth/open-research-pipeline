# Automated Research Pipeline: From Queue Jobs to AI-Driven Experiments

## Overview

This document outlines the evolution of a basic training queue from a simple job runner to a comprehensive **automated research pipeline** with AI agents handling analysis, reporting, and publication.

**Current Status**: Basic queueing system with job creation, processing, locking, and error handling (13/13 tests passing)

**Vision**: Transform into an experiment management system with automated analysis, report generation, and research publication pipeline

---

## 1. Current Queueing System

### Core Components

- **Job Creation**: `--create-job` flag creates JSON job files with training config
- **Queue Processing**: Processes jobs in creation order with lock file protection
- **Directory Structure**:

  ```text
  queue/
  ├── job_20250916_143052.json
  ├── job_20250916_143153.json
  completed/
  ├── job_20250916_143052.json
  failed/
  ├── job_20250916_143153.json (with error details)
  ```

- **Lock File**: `queue.lock` prevents concurrent execution
- **Error Handling**: Failed jobs moved to `failed/` with cleanup

### Limitations

- Only tracks completion/failure, no results validation
- No explicit success criteria
- No automated analysis or reporting
- No experiment metadata or genealogy

- **Config**: `matches_expected` - verify hyperparameters saved correctly

#### 2. Metrics & Logs

- **Training History**: `contains_keys` - ensure all expected metrics present
- **Evaluation Results**: `threshold` - validate performance meets criteria
- **System Metrics**: `exists` - CPU/memory usage, timing data

#### 3. Analysis Outputs

## 3. W&B Integration as Validation Backbone

### Validation Strategy

1. Training script calls `wandb.finish()` to ensure sync
2. Validation system downloads run data via W&B API
3. Programmatic verification of deliverables and metrics

### Implementation

```python
# Post-training validation
wandb.finish()  # Ensure sync completes

# Download and validate
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run(f"{wandb_project}/{run_id}")

# Check artifacts
artifacts = run.logged_artifacts()
for artifact in artifacts:
    if artifact.type == "model":
        artifact.download()  # Test download
        # Verify model loads correctly
    elif artifact.type == "dataset":
        # Verify data integrity

# Validate metrics
history = run.history()
required_metrics = ["train_loss", "eval_loss", "accuracy"]
for metric in required_metrics:
    assert metric in history.columns, f"Missing required metric: {metric}"
```
